\title{Salinity model as used by Qiu and Wan (2013)}
\usage{
SalMod(Q.total, SITE = "Val-I75", a.val = NULL, b.val = NULL, Q.thres = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Q.total}{total discharge from freshwater inputs. For Caloosahatchee Estuary this includes tidal basin discharge and}

\item{SITE}{Current mointoring location with estalished salinity relationships. Sites include S79, BR31, Val-I75 and FtMyers. See Qiu and Qan (2013).}

\item{a.val}{alpha value model coefficient}

\item{b.val}{beta value model coefficient}

\item{Q.thres}{discharge threshold}
}
\value{
modeled salinity based on model coefficients and total freshwater discharge
